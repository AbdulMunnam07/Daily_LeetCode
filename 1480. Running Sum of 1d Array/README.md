# Running Sum of 1d Array

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums`, we define a running sum of an array as `runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i])`.

Return the running sum of `nums`.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].



**Example 2:**

# Running Sum of 1d Array

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums`, we define a running sum of an array as `runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i])`.

Return the running sum of `nums`.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4] <br>
Output: [1,3,6,10] <br>
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].


**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1] <br>
Output: [1,2,3,4,5] <br>
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].



### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
