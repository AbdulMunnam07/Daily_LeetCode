# Linked List Cycle Detection

## Problem Description

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Input

- `head`: The head of a linked list.

## Output

- A boolean value indicating whether there is a cycle in the linked list.
