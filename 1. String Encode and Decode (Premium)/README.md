# Encode and Decode Strings

## Problem Description

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings into a single string. The encoded string should then be decodable back to the original list of strings.

## Requirements

Implement two functions:

1. `encode`: Encodes a list of strings to a single string.
2. `decode`: Decodes the encoded string back into the original list of strings.

## Examples

### Example 1
- **Input:** `["neet","code","love","you"]`
- **Output:** `["neet","code","love","you"]`

### Example 2
- **Input:** `["we","say",":","yes"]`
- **Output:** `["we","say",":","yes"]`

## Constraints
- `0 <= strs.length < 100`
- `0 <= strs[i].length < 200`
- `strs[i]` contains only UTF-8 characters.
